This will install Python, ReproUnzip and all plugins to /opt/reprounzip.

Once this setup is done, you will be able to run reprounzip from the terminal like so:

    /opt/reprounzip/reprounzip --help

You can also add reprounzip to your PATH by adding the line:

    export PATH=/opt/reprounzip:$PATH

to .profile in your home directory.

ReproUnzip now comes with a graphical application that you can use to unpack and reproduce experiments. If you choose to install it, it will be placed in /Applications for you automatically.
